.TH HSH 1 "AUGUST 2023" "HSH" "Simple Shell Manual"
.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from a standard input or a file. It is a simplified version of the Thompson shell.

.SS Interactive Mode
When 
.B hsh
is started in interactive mode (connected to a terminal), it displays a prompt 
.I ($) 
and waits for the user to enter a command. 

.SS Non-Interactive Mode
If 
.B hsh
is started in non-interactive mode (e.g., via a pipe), it reads commands from the standard input and executes them sequentially without displaying a prompt.

.SH BEYOND THE BASICS
.TP
.B Command Execution
After reading a command, 
.B hsh
breaks it into tokens. It then looks for the command in the current PATH. If found, it forks a child process and uses 
.I execve 
to run the program.
.TP
.B PATH Searching
If the command does not contain a slash (/), 
.B hsh
searches for the command in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.

.SH BUILT-INS
The following commands are built into 
.B hsh:
.TP
.B exit
Terminates the shell.
.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B hsh
returns the exit status of the last command executed. If no command was executed, it returns 0. If a command is not found, it returns 127.

.SH EXAMPLES
To start the shell:
.IP
.B ./hsh
.PP
To run a command in non-interactive mode:
.IP
.B echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
